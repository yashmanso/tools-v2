Ecodesign in its original definition is any form of design that minimizes environmentally destructive impacts of products and services. It is often linked to the design of products, material choices and the “after use phase” options. Circular design relates directly to the concept of circular economies where economical growth is decoupled from the use of resources and resources are kept in a constant flow at their highest potential. Ecodesign therefore can be seen as one approach within circular design where the latter is a broader concept, applying design methods on entire product-service-systems and strategic business decisions for sustainable and circular business models.</p>\n<p>The tools included in this toolkit can be filtered based on 'process', 'objective', and 'dimension'.</p>\n<p><img src=\"/tools/tools-ecodesign-toolkitjpeg\" alt=\"Tools - Ecodesign Toolkit.jpeg\"></p>\n"}}],["$","$L2",null,{"attachments":[{"filename":"Tools - Ecodesign Toolkit.jpeg","type":"image","url":"/attachments/Tools%20-%20Ecodesign%20Toolkit.jpeg"}],"pageTitle":"Ecodesign Toolkit"}]]}],[["$","script","script-0",{"src":"/tools-v2/_next/static/chunks/e628ede1e65ba420.js","async":true}]],["$","$L3",null,{"children":["$","$4",null,{"name":"Next.MetadataOutlet","children":"$@5"}]}]]}],"loading":null,"isPartial":false}
