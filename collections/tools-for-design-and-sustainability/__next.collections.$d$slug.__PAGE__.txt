2:T569,<p><a href="https://venturewell.org/tools_for_design/introduction/">VentureWell</a> gathers several tools and frameworks in one place where they offer ways for engineers and designers to monitor their impact. They also provide <a href="https://venturewell.org/tools_for_design/integrating-into-classes/">guidance</a> how to integrate them into classrooms.</p>
<p>The website structures them in several categories. Each category is accompanied by some knowledge nuggets and videos that show case tutorials and practical examples:</p>
<ul>
