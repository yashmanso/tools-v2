Developed through a collaborative effort by academic institutions and supported by regional funding, this tool serves as a learning resource to deepen the understanding of SDG complexities and to guide strategic decision-making towards sustainability. It is structured around a self-assessment methodology that encourages collaborative analysis and prioritization of actions. While it is not a scientific verification of SDG impact, it provides a structured approach to identifying positive and negative impacts, as well as knowledge gaps, related to the SDGs.
