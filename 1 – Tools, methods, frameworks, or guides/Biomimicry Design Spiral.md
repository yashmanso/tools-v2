# Overview
[The Biomimicry Design Spiral ](https://biomimicry.org/biomimicry-design-spiral/)is an innovative framework developed by Carl Hastrich in 2005, which integrates nature's strategies into the design process to address complex challenges. This structured approach consists of six iterative steps: Define, Biologize, Discover, Abstract, Emulate, and Evaluate. It encourages designers to draw inspiration from biological systems and apply these insights to create sustainable solutions. By utilizing this framework, designers and innovators can develop products and systems that are in harmony with the natural world, contributing to a more sustainable human civilization.
