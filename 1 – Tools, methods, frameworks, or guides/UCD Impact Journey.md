# Overview
[The Impact Journey](https://www.ucd.ie/impacttoolkit/plan/impactjourney/) is a strategic tool designed to assist researchers in planning, capturing, communicating, and monitoring the societal impact of their research. This is rooted in the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Logic Model and offers a structured approach to understanding the progression from research activities to long-term societal changes. It is  particularly useful for researchers in sustainable entrepreneurship and innovation, as it helps in identifying the environmental, social, and economic impacts of their work. It is a versatile tool that can be used at any research stage and is instrumental in impact planning, including identifying collaborators and crafting impact sections for funding proposals.
