# Overview
The Cambridge value mapping tool uses a methodical and visual strategy to pinpoint instances of 'value uncapture,' specifically focusing on unsuccessful value exchanges, encompassing missed, depleted, surplus, and absent values. The assessment of value exchange is conducted by considering the perspective of every stakeholder within the business network, ensuring that both the natural environment and the society are acknowledged as distinct voices with their respective stakes in the business.
