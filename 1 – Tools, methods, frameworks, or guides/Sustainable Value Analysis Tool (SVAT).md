# Overview
The Sustainable Value Analysis Tool is designed to aid manufacturers in recognizing and capitalizing on sustainable value creation opportunities throughout a product's life cycle. By analyzing captured and uncaptured value from the beginning of life (BoL), through the middle of life (MoL), to the end of life (EoL), the tool enables companies to systematically identify areas where value is missed, destroyed, surplus, or absent. It consists of a poster for visual mapping and a set of cards for guidance, combining life cycle thinking with value forms analysis. The five-step process involves defining life cycle stages, mapping stakeholder value, identifying uncaptured value, pinpointing value opportunities, and assessing their feasibility and sustainability. While the tool is comprehensive and strategically generates business opportunities, it may lack the necessary guidance on strategic planning for realizing these opportunities.
