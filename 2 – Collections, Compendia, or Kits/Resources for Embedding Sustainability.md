[Embedding project](https://embeddingproject.org/resources/) has curated a selection of most relevant resources to help users recognize their part in contributing positively to a more sustainable future.

Additionally, they offer links to additional resources such as [sustainable goals database](https://embeddingproject.org/goals-database/), [sustainable issue snapshots](https://embeddingproject.org/issue-snapshots/), and a [sustainable procurement wheel](https://embeddingproject.org/procurement-wheel/). They offer another classification based on the several other themes too: [systems](https://embeddingproject.org/resources/systems/),[strategy](https://embeddingproject.org/resources/strategy/)[governance](https://embeddingproject.org/resources/governance/), [value chains](https://embeddingproject.org/resources/value-chains/), [culture](https://embeddingproject.org/resources/culture/), [Change Agents](https://embeddingproject.org/resources/change-agents/),  and [storytelling](https://embeddingproject.org/resources/storytelling/).
