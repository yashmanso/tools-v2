[VentureWell](https://venturewell.org/tools_for_design/introduction/) gathers several tools and frameworks in one place where they offer ways for engineers and designers to monitor their impact. They also provide [guidance](https://venturewell.org/tools_for_design/integrating-into-classes/) how to integrate them into classrooms.

The website structures them in several categories. Each category is accompanied by some knowledge nuggets and videos that show case tutorials and practical examples:

- [**Whole System Mapping](https://venturewell.org/tools_for_design/whole-systems-mapping/)
- [**Measuring Sustainability](https://venturewell.org/tools_for_design/measuring-sustainability/)
- [**Greener Materials](https://venturewell.org/tools_for_design/greener-materials/)
- [**Lightweighting](https://venturewell.org/tools_for_design/lightweighting/)
- [**Circular Economy](https://venturewell.org/tools_for_design/design-lifetime-sharing/)
- [**Energy Effectiveness](https://venturewell.org/tools_for_design/energy-effectiveness/)
- [**Changing Lifestyles](https://venturewell.org/tools_for_design/energy-effectiveness/)
