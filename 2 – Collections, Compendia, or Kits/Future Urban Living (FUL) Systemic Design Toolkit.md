The [FUL](https://www.futureurbanliving.com/#impact)'s tools for systemic design offer support from hypothesis generation and concept evaluation, to service mapping and impact evaluation. This enables to evolve  project idea into a complete product service system, while understanding its impact on the local context and natural ecosystem. These tools are particularly useful to gain control of the flows of materials and resources involved in a product service, and map the potential partners that can support businesses by recovering externalities into new product services.

An open source template of these tools can be found in their [Miro](https://miro.com/app/board/o9J_ldo0c2g=/?fromEmbed=1) page where examples of how the canvases can be filled in are provided.
