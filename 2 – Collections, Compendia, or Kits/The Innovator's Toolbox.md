[Board of Innovation](https://www.boardofinnovation.com/tools/) offers several business related tools that primarily focus on the financial aspects of innovating and entrepreneuring. A few of the canvases stick out as they relate to social impact of such activities. 

# Social Impact Toolkit
First one is the [Social Impact Toolkit](https://www.boardofinnovation.com/tools/social-impact-toolkit/). This toolkit is created for nonprofits and businesses that want to create partnerships that drive change. It helps by directing the user to get an overview of the 17 UN Global Goals and find out what the related targets are.
