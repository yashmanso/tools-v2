[Circular Design project](https://www.circulardesign.it/) is the output of a three years PhD research on Design for X (X = a circular design strategy) at University Iuav of Venice. In essence it is an open-source collection of systemic design strategies to accelerate the circular economy. The aim of this project is to help companies and students to learn, explore, play and try to use a collaborative approach to accelerate the circular economy from the earliest phase of the design process. The Circular Design project is managed by Alessio Franconi.

There are several useful tools and guides [listed](https://www.circulardesign.it/online-tools/) related to circular materials, circular business models, circular design, fashion, systemic design, and pure sustainability tools.
