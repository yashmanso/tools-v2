[Sustainable design toolkit](https://www.sdfy.org/sustainable-design-tools) offers several tools that are not intended to replace but to complement the existing movements such as the Circular Economy or Transition Design and address the challenges of people who work in environments that have been slow to change, for whom meaningful change seem far out of reach.

8 tools are included in this toolkit. They attend to different aspects of the design process. Each tool nudges the user into optimizing different aspects of their design process in line with the principles of sustainable design.
