The goal of “[build a sustainability plan 101](https://supplychain.edf.org/resources/build-a-sustainability-plan-101-introduction/)” is to provide the steps and resources to get started on a sustainability journey. The approach and tools are captured in seven essential steps. As part of each step there are tools that help guide action. The plan is loosely based on a [guide](https://hbr.org/2016/10/the-comprehensive-business-case-for-sustainability) about a comprehensive business case for sustainability published at Harvard Business Review.
