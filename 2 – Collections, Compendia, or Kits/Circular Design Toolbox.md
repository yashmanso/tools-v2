[Ellen McArthur Foundation](https://www.ellenmacarthurfoundation.org/topics/circular-design/tools) has gathered a series of tools and resources that can be used by designers to adopt the principles of circular economy and put theory into practice.

They offer tools that are developed by or co-created with the Ellen MacArthur Foundation (first image) and also those that are developed by other design institutions and organizations (second image).
