# Rational for the organization of the Toolbox

The chosen dimensions are designed to create a structured and comprehensive platform that caters to a diverse audience with varying needs and interests. Below, the dimensions and a short descriptions about them is presented. In the following the tags associated with them are presented:

1. **Resource Type**: This dimension helps users identify the kind of resources they are looking for, whether it's for academic purposes, practical application, or self-guided learning. It ensures that the platform can cater to different learning styles and needs by specifying the type of material in question.

2. **Objective**: By categorizing resources based on their objectives, users can quickly find those that align with their current goals, whether it's mapping out a concept, assessing a market, reporting findings, or aligning their business with sustainability goals.

3. **Target Audience**: Sustainable entrepreneurship and innovation are broad fields that can be applied in various contexts. Specifying the target audience allows resources to be matched with the specific needs and knowledge levels of different groups, from students to policymakers.

4. **Sustainability Focus**: This is the core of the platform. Each resource should contribute to one or more aspects of sustainability, ensuring that users can find resources that align with their specific focus, whether it is environmental, social, or economic sustainability.

5. **Innovation Type**: Innovation can occur in different areas of a business or society. By tagging resources with the type of innovation they relate to, users can find inspiration and guidance that is relevant to their particular innovation challenge.

6. **Entrepreneurship Stage**: Entrepreneurial ventures evolve over time, and the resources needed at each stage can vary greatly. This dimension helps entrepreneurs find resources that are relevant to their venture's current stage of development.

7. **Scope of Relevance**: The geographical, demographic, or societal scope of a resource can greatly affect its applicability. This dimension ensures that users can find resources that are pertinent to the scale at which they operate or are interested in.

8. **Methodological Approach**: This dimension is particularly useful for researchers and students who are looking for resources that align with a specific methodological approach to study or implement sustainable entrepreneurship.

9. **Skill Development**: Entrepreneurship and innovation require a diverse set of skills. By categorizing resources based on the skills they help to develop, users can focus on areas where they need improvement or further development.

10. **Source and Credibility**: The credibility of a resource is important for its acceptance and application. This dimension helps users identify the level of trust they can place in the information based on its source.

11. **Prerequisites and Requirements**: Users can filter resources based on their own level of expertise or the resources they have available, ensuring that they find resources that they can actually use and follow.

12. **Collaboration Level**: Many sustainability challenges require collaborative efforts. This dimension helps users find resources that are designed for individual, team, or community efforts, as well as those that facilitate cross-sector partnerships.

By organizing the platform along these dimensions, users can efficiently navigate the library of resources and find those most relevant to their specific context, needs, and goals. This systematic approach also ensures that the platform can evolve and expand over time, accommodating new resources and emerging trends in the field of sustainable entrepreneurship and innovation.
