<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>Circular Business Model Planning Tool is designed to guide companies in integrating circular economy principles into their business models throughout the product life cycle. It emphasizes the importance of maintaining the value embedded in products for as long as possible by focusing on strategies such as design for longevity, repair, refurbishment, remanufacturing, and material recovery. The tool aims to help businesses plan and analyze their business model elements at various life cycle stages, recognize interdependencies, and identify opportunities to capture residual value and increase resource efficiency. It is particularly useful for companies looking to implement circular strategies.</p>
