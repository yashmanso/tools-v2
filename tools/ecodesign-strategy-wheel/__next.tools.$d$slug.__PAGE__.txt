<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The <a href="http://www.okala.net/Okala%20Ecodesign%20Strategy%20Guide%202012.pdf">Okala Ecodesign Strategy Wheel </a> is an innovative tool designed to assist designers and system developers in reducing the ecological impact of products, services, or systems throughout their life cycle. It clusters ecodesign strategies according to different stages of the product life cycle, serving as a brainstorming aid to uncover new areas for sustainable development. This tool is a modification of the original wheel by <a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/258630081_Application_of_ecodesign_strategies_amongst_Australian_industrial_design_consultancies/figures?lo=1">Brezet and van Hemel (1997)</a> and is part of the Okala Practitioner Guide. It requires an assessment to measure product system impacts for ecological effectiveness. The Okala Ecodesign Strategy Wheel, along with complementary tools such as the Ecodesign Matrix and D4S Strategic Wheel Analysis, guides businesses to adopt environmentally conscious manufacturing strategies.</p>
