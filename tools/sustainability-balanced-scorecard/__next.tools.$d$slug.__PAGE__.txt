<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.threebility.com/sustainability-balanced-scorecard">The Sustainability Balanced Scorecard</a> (SBSC) is an evolved performance management tool that integrates sustainability into the traditional Balanced Scorecard framework. It enables companies to incorporate environmental, social, and ethical considerations into their strategic planning and performance measurement. The SBSC guides organizations in setting and monitoring key performance indicators (KPIs) across the three pillars of sustainability, ensuring a comprehensive approach to corporate responsibility. This tool is particularly useful for businesses seeking to align their strategies with sustainable development goals and for those aiming to achieve significant improvements in areas such as product innovation, process optimization, and customer satisfaction.</p>
