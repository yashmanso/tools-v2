<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The UCD Impact Planning Canvas is a tool designed to assist researchers in effectively planning and managing the societal impact of their research. It is versatile, allowing for use at various stages of the research process, and supports a range of activities from identifying collaborators to reflecting on completed projects. The Canvas encourages a flexible approach, utilizing post-it notes for dynamic interaction, and requires a minimal time investment of 15-30 minutes. It is complemented by additional resources, including instructional videos and worked examples.</p>
