<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://www.use2use.se/">Use2Use Design Toolkit!</a> is a collection of tools aimed at promoting user-centered circular design within organizations. Developed through collaborative efforts, it won the EIT Raw Materials and Circular Societies Prize in 2021 for its innovative approach to sustainable design. The toolkit is divided into three packs: the Thinking Activation Pack, which fosters circular design thinking; the Circular Journeys Exploration Pack, which aids in understanding product life cycles and user interactions; and the Circular Designs Ideation Pack, which encourages the creation of circular design concepts. It has been used by various companies, particularly in the fashion and textiles industry, to integrate circular principles into their design processes.</p>
