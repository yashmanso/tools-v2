<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Triple Layered Business Model Canvas is an innovative tool that expands the traditional business model canvas by integrating two additional layers: an environmental layer, which emphasizes a lifecycle perspective, and a social layer, which focuses on a stakeholder perspective. This holistic approach ensures that a business model not only generates economic value but also addresses environmental and social impacts, promoting sustainability. The tool aids in visualizing and communicating a business's comprehensive value proposition, encouraging creative and sustainable business model innovation. This innovative canvas contributes to sustainable business model research by structuring sustainability considerations into the business model design process.</p>
