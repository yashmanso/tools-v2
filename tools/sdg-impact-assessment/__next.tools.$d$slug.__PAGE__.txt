<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The <a href="https://sdgimpactassessmenttool.org/en-gb/tool/assessments">SDG Impact Assessment Tool</a> is an interactive online platform designed to assist organizations in evaluating their activities' alignment with the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Developed through a collaborative effort by academic institutions and supported by regional funding, this tool serves as a learning resource to deepen the understanding of SDG complexities and to guide strategic decision-making towards sustainability. It is structured around a self-assessment methodology that encourages collaborative analysis and prioritization of actions. While it is not a scientific verification of SDG impact, it provides a structured approach to identifying positive and negative impacts, as well as knowledge gaps, related to the SDGs.</p>
