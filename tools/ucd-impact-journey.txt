<h1>Overview</h1>
<p><a href="https://www.ucd.ie/impacttoolkit/plan/impactjourney/">The Impact Journey</a> is a strategic tool designed to assist researchers in planning, capturing, communicating, and monitoring the societal impact of their research. This is rooted in the W.K. Kellogg Foundation Logic Model and offers a structured approach to understanding the progression from research activities to long-term societal changes. It is  particularly useful for researchers in sustainable entrepreneurship and innovation, as it helps in identifying the environmental, social, and economic impacts of their work. It is a versatile tool that can be used at any research stage and is instrumental in impact planning, including identifying collaborators and crafting impact sections for funding proposals.</p>

<h1>Dimensions</h1>
<p><strong>Resource Type</strong>
The Impact Journey is a descriptive and conceptual framework and practical tool that guide researchers through the process of achieving societal impact. ^a8e820</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags:  #tool, #canvas</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Objective</strong>
This resource aims to align research activities with their potential societal impact, ensuring that the outcomes contribute to sustainable development goals.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags: #align, #map</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Target Audience</strong>
The primary users of this resource are researchers and academics, looking to maximize the societal impact of their work.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags: #researchers, #educators, #policy-makers</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Sustainability Focus</strong>
The Impact Journey emphasizes the importance of considering the long-term environmental, social, and economic implications of research by tracing research over time, distinguishing between different five stages on the pathway to impact.</p>
<ul>
<li>Tags: #environmental-sustainability, #social-sustainability, #economic-sustainability, #SDGs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Innovation Type</strong>
