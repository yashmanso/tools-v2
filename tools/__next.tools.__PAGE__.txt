[The Impact Compass](https://www.gsb.stanford.edu/experience/about/centers-institutes/csi/impact-compass) is an analytical tool created by the Center for Social Innovation at Stanford University, designed to help individuals and organizations evaluate and maximize their social impact. It focuses on six key dimensions: value to society, environmental and social governance, mission alignment, scalability, impact magnitude, and efficacy. This tool is particularly useful for decision-making processes where the goal is to determine the most effective allocation of resources towards activities that generate positive social outcomes. The idea is to conform to three main principles: no proven failure, no negative societal outcome, and no unethical behavior. These three main principles are called the Three Big No’s. The goal for organizations is to clear the Three Big No’s and they maximize their impact by working with the six dimensions, each contributing to the overall evaluation of an entity’s impact potential.
