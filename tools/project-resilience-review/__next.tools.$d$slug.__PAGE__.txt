<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Project Resilience Review is a comprehensive framework designed to evaluate and enhance the sustainability of projects by examining their alignment with the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It prompts users to consider the long-term impact of their project's direction and practice, including potential challenges and opportunities. The framework encourages the integration of new competencies and collaboration to bolster project resilience and competitiveness. There is also an emphasis on the importance of awareness regarding the environmental, social, and economic implications of project methodologies and partnerships. This resource is particularly useful for project groups seeking to ensure their work contributes positively to sustainability goals and is adaptable to future changes in the global landscape.</p>
