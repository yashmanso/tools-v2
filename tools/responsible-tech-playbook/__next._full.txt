<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>The Responsible Tech Playbook is a compilation of resources designed to highlight inclusivity, bias awareness, and transparency in the realm of technology. It helps individuals and organizations address the ethical implications of technology. A self-assessment tool in the playbook assesses the social and environmental impact of technology projects and provides a framework for balancing economic benefits with ethical considerations. The tool includes a checklist that covers areas such as privacy, sustainability and human-rights. The aim of the tool is to empower tech professionals and decision-makers to think about the wider societal impact of their work and make more responsible decisions when creating and implementing technology solutions.</p>
