# Attachments Directory

This directory contains all PDF files, images, and other attachments referenced in the markdown files.

## Structure

Files should be placed directly in this directory with their original names as referenced in the markdown files.

For example:
- `Biomimicards-EN.pdf`
- `Design.Spiral-Diagram_10.17.pdf`
- `Pasted image 20240130152947.png`
